# SORTING-VISUALIZER
Many students find Sorting Algorithms difficult because it requires abstract thinking. So, to ease up the hardships of the students this idea of the project was formed. Our website of Sorting Algorithms is both interactive and attractive to students. It is a web-based animation tool to visualise common Sorting Algorithms like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort. It gives the students hands on the experience of the algorithmsâ€™ implementation. It feeds into their imagination to help them get a better understanding while also helping teachers to make their students understand better. Through this project every student can learn at their own pace with their own speed. This interface is designed to make one feel fully engaged and concentrated. We have made use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript language for our project. The aim of the project is to make learning less of a burden and more of an incredible experience which leaves students with the want to learn more!
